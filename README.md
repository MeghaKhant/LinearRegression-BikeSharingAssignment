## General Information
- This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes in the American market using a multiple linear regression model.
- **Background:** A bike-sharing system is a service where bikes are available for short-term use for a fee or free. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has seen a significant drop in revenue. They seek to understand the factors affecting bike demand to prepare for a post-pandemic market.
- **Business Problem:** BoomBikes needs to identify the significant variables influencing bike demand to adjust their business strategy and meet customer expectations, thereby improving profitability.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used contains daily bike demand information and various factors such as weather, season, and user types.

## Conclusions
- The year variable (`yr`) is significant in predicting bike demand, indicating an increasing trend in bike-sharing popularity.
- Weather conditions (`weathersit`) significantly affect bike demand, with clear weather leading to higher demand.
- Temperature (`temp` and `atemp`) positively correlates with bike demand, indicating higher usage during warmer days.
- Seasonal variations play a crucial role, with summer and fall showing higher demand compared to spring and winter.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas - version 1.x
- numpy - version 1.x
- matplotlib - version 3.x
- seaborn - version 0.x
- scikit-learn - version 0.x
- statsmodels - version 0.x

## Acknowledgements
